## Overview

This project implements a programmable DC power supply that takes power from a USB-C Power Delivery adapter and outputs an adjustable voltage suitable for embedded systems and power electronics applications. It was developed to explore practical USB-C PD negotiation, safe power-path control, and firmware–hardware interaction in modern power systems.

The goal is to replace fixed-voltage adapters with a single, flexible USB-C input capable of powering a wide range of devices through negotiated, standards-compliant power delivery.
